# My Journey through Harvard CS50

Welcome to my repository documenting my educational journey through Harvard's CS50 course. This experience has been nothing short of exceptional, providing me with a solid foundation in various computer science concepts. From arrays and algorithms to memory management and data structures.

## Highlights from My Favorite Problem Sets

Throughout the course, I encountered numerous challenging problem sets, but a few stood out as my favorites:

### [**Credit**](c/problemset1/credit.c)

In the first problem set, I tackled the "Credit" problem. This task involved implementing a program to validate credit card numbers, where I had to utilize my newfound knowledge of C to create a solution.

### [**Substitution**](arrays/problemset2/substitution.c)

Problem set 2 introduced the "Substitution" challenge. I had the opportunity to craft a program that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher. This task was a captivating exercise in array manipulation.

### [**DNA**](python/problemset6/dna/dna.py)

Python made its debut in problem set 6 with the "DNA" challenge. I wrote a Python script to analyze DNA sequences, demonstrating my versatility in programming languages and problem-solving techniques.

### [**Finance**](https://github.com/code50/124291493/tree/main/finance)

One of the standout problem sets was "Finance," where I embarked on building a web application for tracking stocks. It was an exciting project that honed my web development skills and financial knowledge.

### [**CS50 Final Project**](https://github.com/edulustosa/cs50-final-project)

Finally, after so much effort in the course, I completed the CS50 Final Project. This project is a real-time chat application that enables users to have conversations in a global chat room.

These are just a glimpse of the many incredible challenges I encountered in CS50. This repository serves as a testament to my dedication and the invaluable knowledge I gained from this course.
