Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 

Below 1000 simulations, I think the predictions were very inaccurate.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
